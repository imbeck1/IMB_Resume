                        <p>
                            Java is the first programming language I learned. The Computer Science program at Appalachain State University uses Java
                            as the primary language for foundational programming education. Java is an object-oriented language, so learning it taught me 
                            how to structure methods and classes to write neat, efficient code.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            Python is a functional programming language that I have varied experience with. I have used it in the past for web scraping and data collection.
                            One of my primary uses for Python was in a Machine Learning for Cybersecurity class. In this class I used Python to organize and sort data to then
                            write prediction models for future outcomes.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            I only ever used R for a Data class. I remember using this language to make graphs and tables and sort large sets of data. I don't remember
                            what algorithms I wrote specifically with this language, but I remember doing well in the class.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            I learned SQL for my Database class at Appalachain State. I have refreshed myself on the language on several occasions as proficiency in the language
                            seems to be a desired skill among many employers. Most recently, I used SQL in a database I implimented for my IMB_Realty project. (See projects page.)

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            I mostly used C in my low-level programming classes. When I took Intro to Computer Systems, I learned C after working with Assembly. Learning 
                            C in this way gave me a strong connection between high-level programming languages and low-level machine language. I only ever used C to write 
                            simple programs meant to show how functions, variables, and memory worked at a low level.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            C++ was the next language I learned after C. This was the final step I took when learning Computer Systems. This was the high-level language 
                            that I learned to relate with C, which related with Assembly. With this language I learned to simulate an X84 processor. That was the final project
                            for the 3 Systems classes I took. This project tied together my Systems learning and gave me a good overview of everything I learned.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            I learned HTML in my front-end development class at Appalachain State. I quickly loved HTML and how quickly it enabled me to write programs and
                            see them in a visually pleasing way through the browser. HTML continues to be a language that I actively practice in, as Front End Development 
                            is the career path I am the most interested in.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            CSS is one of the most fun and creative languages I have learned. The thing I love most about programming is the creativity that comes with 
                            writing code and problem-solving. CSS provides opportunity for the most creativity. With CSS, I've been able to take a vision that only exists 
                            in my mind, and put that design on a webpage. I have been able to make professional looking sites quickly when working with CSS. Every time I work with 
                            CSS, there is always a new trick that I find to make my work look more professional. It is one of my favorite languages.

                    <div class="info-text">
                        <p>
                            I learned JavaScript to add functionality to my web pages. JavaScript always reminded me of Python, as it is a functional language rather than 
                            an object oriented one. The main project I used JavaScript for was my Bookify (see projects page) project. I used JavaScript and Node.js to work with 
                            web APIs and integrate them into my Node.js server. I continue to use JavaScript in my Web Development projects to this day.

                        <p>
                            C# is the language I learned most recently. I learned it to practice web development with .NET and Blazor. I used this language in the most recent 
                            project that I worked on (see projects page): IMB_Realty. C# reminds me of JavaScript, as it is a functional language that is used to add functionality
                            to web projects.
