                            I have always had a passion for technology, even when I was young. I didn't start learning to code until I started college at Appalachian State University, 
                            but I had many ongoing tech-based projects before then. Once I began programming, I had an immediate love for it. I found new ways to be creative using 
                            technology. I love to solve puzzles and find solutions for problems, and programming provides a way to expand your mind and think in many different directions 
                            to solve problems creatively and accomplish goals efficiently. I gained a strong foundation in programming and development during my time in college. I 
                            worked in various disciplines to prepare me for many different career opportunities. The career area I'm drawn to the most is web development. I like how 
                            quickly you can see your code work in the browser, and how creative you can be with tools like CSS. Since I graduated, I have worked mostly on honing my web 
                            development skills and continue to learn new technologies and workflows to prepare me for a career development. I have a lot to learn, especially when it 
                            comes to development at a professional scale, but I am eager for knowledge and experience. Please browse this website to get an idea of my skills and experience. 
                            I strive to continue gaining knowledge in this field and to build creative, well written programs.
